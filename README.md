Student Development Application

Creating a mobile application that will serve various needs such as

a)	Track attendance

b)	Provide important information and updates to students e.g. circulars, results, exam dates, timing, time table etc.

c)	Bus routes 

When a student takes admission in any college, he/she is allotted a roll number/ id number. When student downloads this app and add his/her roll number, he/she should get all the updates for his/her college as they are circulated. This application can become a one stop shop for all the information need.

College can even share the results, mark sheets, necessary certificates such as domicile certificates etc through the application which currently takes a lot of bandwidth from college administration to complete these tasks physically.

The hierarchy of this application will be:

State   --->   University   --->   Affiliated Colleges   --->   Enrolled Students   --->   Academic Reports
